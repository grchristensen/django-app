Test Driven Development

To install project dependencies run:

```
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

To start the server run:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

To execute the unit tests run:

```
python manage.py test
```

To execute the functional tests run:

```
python functional_tests.py
```

The unit tests should pass, and the functional tests will fail because the parts from later chapters
are not finished yet.
